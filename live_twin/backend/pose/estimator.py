"""
MediaPipe Pose Landmarker wrapper (Tasks API — the old `mp.solutions.pose`
API is gone as of mediapipe 0.10.35) — extracts the arm landmarks the rest
of the pipeline needs (shoulder, elbow, wrist).

Two entry points:
- ArmPoseEstimator: VIDEO-mode, stateful, for the live webcam stream in main.py.
  Auto mode locks onto one arm side per session (once a side clears the
  visibility threshold, it stays picked unless it drops below threshold)
  instead of re-deciding every frame, which could otherwise flip which arm
  it's tracking mid-session if both are visible. Callers can instead force a
  side via set_side() — a *forced* side never silently falls back to the
  other arm, because a user who asked to train their left arm being quietly
  switched to their right is a safety problem, not a convenience.
- detect_pose_in_image: IMAGE-mode, one-off, for still calibration photos in
  placement/pipeline.py. Accepts an optional `side` to force a specific arm
  (so all 5 calibration photos can be locked to the one the `relaxed` shot
  picked, rather than each photo independently guessing).

Neither returns a low-confidence guess when the arm doesn't clear
MIN_LANDMARK_VISIBILITY. ArmPoseEstimator.read() reports *why* it has no
landmarks (no person in frame vs. person visible but the wanted arm isn't),
so the UI can tell the user what to actually do about it.

Needs a downloaded model file — see scripts/download_pose_model.py.
