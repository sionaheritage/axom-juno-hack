    These are tight crops around the UPPER ARM (shoulder to elbow) of
    {selected_arm}. The first image is relaxed and the second image is
    tensed/flexed. Analyze only the upper arm in these crops.

    POSE GROUNDING FROM YOLO:
    {spatial_context}

    1. Identify the movement by comparing the first and second images.
    2. Identify the primary visibly tensed muscles. Prioritize large arm
       movements; only consider finger movement when the arm has not changed.
       Distinguish anatomical surfaces before assigning names: biceps is on
       the anterior/flexion side of the upper arm and triceps is posterior,
       opposite the elbow's closing direction. Never swap a correctly located
       biceps region with a triceps label.
    3. In the SECOND CROP, trace each affected visible muscle region with 5-10
       polygon vertices ordered clockwise around its OUTER boundary. Never
       return fewer than 5 corners. Cover the
       full visible length and width of the muscle belly. Place vertices where
       the visible arm or muscle outline actually changes direction; do not
       space them evenly and do not regularize the outline into a rectangle,
       trapezoid, or other symmetrical shape. Follow the irregular curved arm
       silhouette, including the visible left or right arm edge when the muscle
       reaches it. Do not return a small box or thin shape near the crop center.
    4. Return all polygon and EMS pad coordinates relative to the SECOND CROP:
       - origin (0, 0) is exactly the TOP-LEFT corner
       - x=0 is the LEFT edge and x=1 is the RIGHT edge
       - y=0 is the TOP edge and y=1 is the BOTTOM edge
       - x increases only left-to-right; y increases only top-to-bottom
       - x = pixel_x / crop_width; y = pixel_y / crop_height
       - every value must be between 0.0 and 1.0
       - (0.5, 0.5) means the exact center of the crop; do not use it unless
         the target muscle pixel is actually at the center
       - every vertex and pad must lie on visible upper-arm pixels, not at a
         generic anatomical location
    5. Return at least a proximal and distal EMS pad for each muscle. Place pads
       at distinct natural positions along the curved muscle belly. Do not put
       them in a rigid horizontal or vertical column, mirror their coordinates,
       or use evenly spaced default positions.
